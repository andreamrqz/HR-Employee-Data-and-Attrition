## Dashboard in Tableau
A comprehensive dashboard was created in Tableau to visualize these insights. The data table used for the dashboard was generated by consolidating the four CSV files from Kaggle. This dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the data and the insights derived from it.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the companyâ€™s employee distribution, salary ranges, satisfaction levels, and tenure. The Tableau dashboard complements this analysis by offering a visual representation of the data, facilitating better understanding and decision-making.

## Future Work
Further analysis can be done to explore trends over time, predict attrition, and understand the impact of different factors on employee satisfaction and performance.
